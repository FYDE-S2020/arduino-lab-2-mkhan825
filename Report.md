Questions 

What is the purpose of an IP address? 

An Ip Address is a way for a computer to be able to differentiate from one computer to another. And it also carried locational data. 

What is a DNS? What are the benefits of using domain names instead of IP addresses?

A DNS is a way to address certain domains on the internet. Such as google.com. It is a lot easier to remember certain domains than it is to remember their IP addresses. 

What is the difference between a static IP and a dynamic IP? 

A static IP stays the same while a dynamic IP is able to change. 

What is the tradeoff between UDP and TCP protocols?

UDP is faster but you can miss data and TCP is slower but is more correct.

Why can't we use the delay function with Blynk? 

We can't use a delay function with Blynk in order to let our components work in parallel (so that we aren't stuck to doing one at the same time). 

What does it mean for a function to be "Blocking"? 

Blocking means that a function will not continue with what it's doing until something sets off a flag for it to continue. 

Why are interrupts useful for writing Non-Blocking code? 

Interupts allow us to do multiple things at the same time, so when the input needed for the non-blocking code is not there, it will just let us do what we want until it is received. Once received, it will basically go back to fill in the blanks. 

What is the difference between interface and implementation? Why is it important? 

Interface is used in order to create a structure so that in the future if we want to do something, it will be available. But implementation means to actually do the action that you are specifying.
